# Knights-Travalis

Knights Travalis is a Odin Project that is meant mimic the behavior of a knight on a 8x8 chess board.
The objective is to find the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way. I did this by creating a factory for the individual squares and a knight. 
Currently this is implemented with breadth-first search to find the ending position and then traced back to reveal the path.
