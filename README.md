# Knights-Travalis
Knights Travalis Odin Javascript Project 

    Knights Travalis is a Odin Project that is meant mimic the behavior of a knight on a 8x8 chess board. The objective is to find the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way. I did this by creating a factory for the individual squares and a knight. Currently this is implemented with breadth-first search to find the ending position and then traced back to reveal the path. 

Requirements: 

    1. create a gameboard of 8x8 
    2. create a knight
    3. create a tree of possible moves for knight. move are the children
    4. decide which search algorithum is best to use
    5. find the shortest path between starting and ending position
